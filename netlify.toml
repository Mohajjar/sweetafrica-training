The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed because it was unable to fetch cached dependencies, which resulted in no cached dependencies being found, triggering the setup to clone a fresh repository and install dependencies.

**Solution:**
Given that the build was unable to fetch cached dependencies, ensure that all required dependencies are included in the `package.json` file and that any necessary files are present and committed to the repository. By verifying the presence of the required dependencies and files in the repository, you can help avoid dependency-fetching issues during the build process.
